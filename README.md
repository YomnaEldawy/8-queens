# 8 Queens

## Overview
The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard
so that no two queens threaten each other, thus, a solution requires that no two queens
share the same row, column, or diagonal. <br>
In this repository, we implement different algorithms to solve the 8 queens problem starting from any initial state.
## How to contribute
1. create a directory with name eight-queens
    ```
    mkdir eight-queens
    cd eight-queens
    ```

2. Initialize a git repository using 
    ``` 
    git init
    ```
3.  execute the following command:
    ``` 
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YomnaEldawy/8-queens.git
    ```
    then enter your username and password.
4. execute
    ```bash
    git pull origin stage
    git checkout stage
    ```
5. create a new branch with the name of the algorithm or class you are implementing using the following command (I will provide feature1 as an example)
    ``` 
    git checkout -b feature1
    ```
6. when you are done with your class, commit and push the branch to the repo using the following commands

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "commit message"
    git push origin csp #the name of the branch
    ```
7. If you want to implement a new feature (Either you are finished with the first one or not), execute the following commands: I assume you are now implementing feature1 and want to start working on feature2

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "commit message"
    git checkout stage
    git checkout -b feature2
    ```
